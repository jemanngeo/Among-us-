# Among Us: AI-Powered Cloud Anomaly Detection Dashboard
🚀 Among Us is an AI-powered anomaly detection system for cloud infrastructure. It provides real-time insights into traffic patterns, system metrics, logs, and asset/patch management. The system uses statistical (MAD) and machine learning models (Isolation Forest, LOF) to detect anomalies in cloud environments.

# 🌟 Features
- **Traffic Overview:** View real-time traffic data and detect unusual patterns.
- **System Metrics:** Monitor key metrics like CPU usage, memory, and disk I/O.
- **System Logs:** Analyze system logs for irregularities and anomalies.
- **Asset & Patch Management:** Manage and track cloud assets and their patch statuses.
- **Virtual Bot:** Interact with the system using a virtual assistant for anomaly queries and insights.

# 🛠️ Installation
### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.7+**
- **Required Python libraries:** Ensure all dependencies are installed using the requirements.txt file.
### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/among-us.git

```
# 🛠️ Usage
To start anomaly detection and monitor the dashboard, follow these steps:
1. **Prepare Your Environment:** Ensure your cloud metrics and logs are accessible.
2. **Run the Dashboard:**
```bash
python amongus_dashboard.py
```
3. **Interact with the Virtual Bot:** The virtual assistant will assist in querying detected anomalies and system performance.
# 📂 Project Structure


# 🔧 Customization
